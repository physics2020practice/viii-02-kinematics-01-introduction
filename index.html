				In general, there are <em><span style="background-color:#ffff00">social sciences</span></em><em>, which deal with human society and individual relationships, and </em><em><span style="background-color:#ffff00">natural sciences</span></em><em>, which investigate the natural universe. In turn, the </em><em><span style="background-color:#ffff00">natural sciences</span></em><em> are divided into the </em><em><span style="background-color:#ffff00">biological sciences</span></em><em> (sometimes called life sciences), which are concerned with the study of living matter, and the </em><em><span style="background-color:#ffff00">physical sciences</span></em><em>, which involve</em> the study of nonliving matter.

			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Physical science is classified into five major divisions (Fig):
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Physics</em>, the most fundamental of the divisions, is concerned with the basic principles and concepts of matter and energy.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Chemistry </em>deals with the composition, structure, and reactions of matter.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Astronomy </em>is the study of the universe, which is the totality of all matter, energy, space, and time.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Meteorology </em>is the study of the atmosphere, from the surface of the Earth to where it ends in outer space.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Geology </em>is the science of the planet Earth: its composition, structure, processes, and history.
			</p>
			<p>
				(The last three physical sciences are sometimes combined as <em>Earth and Space Science</em>.)

				What is matter?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Everything that really exists in the world, on the Earth or out of it, is called matter. Various bodies surrounding us and the substances of which these bodies are composed are material. Sound, light, radio waves are also material objects (although they cannot be called bodies) since they actually exist. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the basic properties of matter is its variability. Various changes occurring in the material world, viz. changes in matter, are called natural phen<em>omena.</em>

			<p>
				What is physics?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Physics is a science dealing with inanimate nature. It studies the properties of matter, its various changes, the laws describing these changes and the relationships between different phenomena.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is a science based on experiments, observation, and <span style="background-color:#ffff00">measurement</span>. Experiments involve making things change. Observation is when scientists watch what they are studying very carefully. Measurement is describing things by their weight, size, or temperature.
			</p>
			<p>
				Physics looks at how tiny atoms are put together. Atoms are tiny particles that make up everything in the universe. Physics looks at how huge planets and stars move. It helps scientists understand the way matter acts. Matter includes the solids, liquids, and gases in the universe. Physics also helps scientists understand how energy acts.

			<p>
				What is importance of physical quantity and its measurement in physics?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				A special feature of physics in comparison with other sciences is that while studying the properties of matter and its changes, various physical quantities are introduced. These quantities can be measured and expressed by figures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Physics deals with quantities that can be measured. Thus, you won't find concepts such as honesty, love, and courage as primary topics of discussion in a physics book.

				What is mechanics?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Mechanics is study of forces and action due to forces which include motion.

				What are branches of mechanics?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Mechanics is divided into two branches called statics and dynamics
			</p>
			<p>
				Statics: This involves study of forces and effect of forces on objects at rest
			</p>
			<p>
				Dynamics : This involves study of forces and effect of forces on objects in motion
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SUBJECTIVE QUESTION </span><span style="color:#4472c4">10</span>

			<p>
				What are two divisions of dynamics?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Two dynamics are kinetics and kinematics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Kinetics : It is branch of mechanics which is concerned about the causes (i.e. force, torque etc.) of motion.
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
				Kinematics : This involves study of motion without studying the cause of motion i.e. force, torque etc.

				What is are two types of physical quantities?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Physical quantities are divided into two types
			</p>
			<p>
				Scalar quantities
			</p>
			<p>
				Vector quantities
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SUBJECTIVE QUESTION </span><span style="color:#4472c4">12</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				What are scalar quantities?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Some-physical quantities are completely specified by just a number and a unit. If we say that a person's mass is 70 kg, that the area of a farm is 160 acres, or that the frequency of a sound wave is 660 cycles/s, there is nothing more to add. These are examples of scalar quantities. That is just magnitude is sufficient to express scalar quantity.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SUBJECTIVE QUESTION </span><span style="color:#4472c4">13</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				What are vector quantities?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				A quantity whose direction is significant is called a vector quantity. Thus velocity, which incorporates direction as well as speed, is a vector quantity. Vector quantities occur often in physics, and their arithmetic is different from the ordinary arithmetic of scalar quantities. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SUBJECTIVE QUESTION </span><span style="color:#4472c4">14</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Are rest and motion relative?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Yes.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="01-introduction/01-introduction.006.png" width="698" height="241" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				For a person standing on ground all the three passengers in the train are moving to the right. For the person in red shirt, the back two passengers are at rest. Thus we can say that rest and motion are relative terms that is rest and motion depends on the observer and whether the observer himself is moving or not.

			</p>
			<p>
				How is vector shown geometrically?
			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="color:#4472c4">SOLUTION</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				A vector can be represented by a line segment with an arrow head.
			</p>
			<p>
				1. The length of the line segment (AB) is proportional to the magnitude of the vector.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="01-introduction/01-introduction.007.png" width="238" height="76" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				2. The arrow head indicates the direction of the vector. 
			</p>
			<p>
				&#xa0;
			</p>
			<p>
				Example: 
			</p>
			<p>
				Consider a man walking along a straight path from P to Q, the length of the path between the two positions being 100 m. Then, this displacement is represented by a directed line segment PQ as shown in the figure.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="01-introduction/01-introduction.008.png" width="266" height="98" alt="" />
			</p>
			<p>
				The direction of the displacement is shown by the arrow and its magnitude is given by the length of the line segment drawn to scale. For example, if the length of the line segment PQ is chosen as 5 cm, the scale considered for drawing the line segment is 1 cm = 20 m. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Instead if the length of the line segment is chosen to be 4 cm, the scale considered for drawing the line segment is 1 cm = 25 m.
			</p>
			<p>
				&#xa0;
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>NOTE</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				An arrow or a short line is drawn above the quantity to represent a vector.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example:
			</p>
			<p>
				<img src="01-introduction/01-introduction.009.png" width="133" height="36" alt="" style="vertical-align:middle" /> , etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes, vectors are shown in boldface, e.g., <strong>F, a, AB, EF</strong>, etc. without vector
